# flock

Welcome to flock! We are a collaborative web application that aims to become the world's first on-demand running club. flock helps people build a community of local runners who share preferences for running pace, distance, and schedule. flock makes it easy to find and join an existing run, or create a new run and post it for others to view and join.

The app is inspired by the personal experience of our contributors, who struggle to find running partners who have similar preferences for run pace and distance.

## Features

flock is a progressive web app that aims to be the one stop shop for runners looking for group run events. Once users sign up for an account, they can immediately begin searching for already existing run events on a map. The run events include important details such as start time, pace, distance, other users who have joined the run, and a map showing the path for the given run. Once a user choses to join a run, they will gain access to a chat room for that run event, in which all users who have joined can chat in real time. If a user includes an address and pace/distance preferences in their profile page, then the map to search for run events will automatically center on the provided address and the available run events will be filted to their pace/distance preferences.

If a user does not like any of the run events, then they can choose to create a new run event with their preferred route path, pace, and start time. If a user does not like any of the route paths that are available, then they can create their own route path by drawing points on a map using a simple polyline drawing tool.

Users can also view a history of their run events on a user stats page.

## Roadmap

We hope to include the following features in the future:

- Add notifications on your device when a new run is created near you or when a run you have joined is about to start
- Integrate the camera into the app so users can have a personalized profile picture and save photos of the run events they have joined
- Utilize the device’s geolocation to set the center of the map when looking for runs and to create a new route path by running the route while holding the device
- A more robust user stats page that shows stunning visuals and interactive charts
